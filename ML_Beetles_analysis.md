Using machine learning to predict/classify species of beetles
================

## Data

Explanation of variables in the data:

- **ID**: ID of the beetle specimen.

- **morphotype**: The species of beetle. All within the genus Hydrobius.
  This is the outcome I want to predict.

- **15 morphological features**: Includes body size, length and width of
  the wings and pronotum, and smaller structures on the males. Most
  measured in mm or Î¼m. Some features are ratios between two lengths.
  One feature characterizing the shape of a structure (mesoShape) is an
  angle that is measured in degrees. See publication for details.

Looking at the number of samples per species.

``` r
table(beetle_data$morphotype)
```


        arcticus     fuscipes rottenbergii  subrotundus 
              22           39           27           35 

Next, looking at how much missing data there is per variable:

``` r
# Missing per variables
naniar::vis_miss(beetle_data)
```

![](ML_Beetles_analysis_files/figure-gfm/missingness-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
# Number of specimens with complete data
table(beetle_data[complete.cases(beetle_data), "morphotype"])
```

    morphotype
        arcticus     fuscipes rottenbergii  subrotundus 
               4            3            3            3 

As seen, there are very few complete cases, primarily do high
missingness in variables that were difficult/time-consuming to measure.
Not ideal, but can imputation to fill in likely missing values.
