# ML_Beetles
Using machine learning to predict/classify species of beetles. Based on data from Fossen et. al. 2016, where 4 species of beetles within the genus Hydrobius were found to be genetically distinct and morphological data was collected per species in an attempt to create identification keys. Here I use machine learning (random forest) to train a model that can classify the species based on morphological test data.
