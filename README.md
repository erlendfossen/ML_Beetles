# ML_Beetles
Using machine learning to predict/classify species of beetles. Based on data from Fossen et. al. 2016, where 4 species of beetles within the genus Hydrobius were found to be genetically distinct and morphological data was collected per species in an attempt to create identification keys. Here I use machine learning (random forest) to train a model that can classify the species based on morphological test data.

Look at **ML_Beetles_analysis.md** for the markdown results and the **ML_Beetles_analysis.rmd** for the full code.
